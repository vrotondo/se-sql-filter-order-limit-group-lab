import sqlite3

##### Part I: Basic Filtering #####

# Create the connection
conn1 = sqlite3.connect('planets.db')

# Select all
all_planets = pd.read_sql("""SELECT * FROM planets; """, conn1)
print("All planets data:")
print(all_planets)
print("\n")

# STEP 1: Return all columns for planets that have 0 moons
df_no_moons = pd.read_sql("""
    SELECT *
    FROM planets
    WHERE num_of_moons = 0;
""", conn1)
print("Planets with no moons:")
print(df_no_moons)
print("\n")

# STEP 2: Return name and mass of planets with name length = 7
df_name_seven = pd.read_sql("""
    SELECT name, mass
    FROM planets
    WHERE LENGTH(name) = 7;
""", conn1)
print("Planets with 7-letter names:")
print(df_name_seven)
print("\n")

##### Part 2: Advanced Filtering #####

# STEP 3: Return name and mass for planets with mass <= 1.00
df_mass = pd.read_sql("""
    SELECT name, mass
    FROM planets
    WHERE mass <= 1.00;
""", conn1)
print("Planets with mass <= 1.00:")
print(df_mass)
print("\n")

# STEP 4: Return all columns for planets with at least one moon and mass < 1.00
df_mass_moon = pd.read_sql("""
    SELECT *
    FROM planets
    WHERE num_of_moons >= 1 AND mass < 1.00;
""", conn1)
print("Planets with at least one moon and mass < 1.00:")
print(df_mass_moon)
print("\n")

# STEP 5: Return name and color of planets with color containing "blue"
df_blue = pd.read_sql("""
    SELECT name, color
    FROM planets
    WHERE color LIKE '%blue%';
""", conn1)
print("Planets with 'blue' in their color:")
print(df_blue)
print("\n")

##### Part 3: Ordering and Limiting #####

# Create a connection to dogs database
conn2 = sqlite3.connect('dogs.db')

# Select all dogs
all_dogs = pd.read_sql("SELECT * FROM dogs;", conn2)
print("All dogs data:")
print(all_dogs)
print("\n")

# STEP 6: Return name, age, breed of hungry dogs sorted by youngest to oldest
df_hungry = pd.read_sql("""
    SELECT name, age, breed
    FROM dogs
    WHERE hungry = 1
    ORDER BY age ASC;
""", conn2)
print("Hungry dogs sorted by age (ascending):")
print(df_hungry)
print("\n")

# STEP 7: Return name, age, hungry for hungry dogs between ages 2-7, sorted alphabetically
df_hungry_ages = pd.read_sql("""
    SELECT name, age, hungry
    FROM dogs
    WHERE hungry = 1 AND age BETWEEN 2 AND 7
    ORDER BY name ASC;
""", conn2)
print("Hungry dogs between ages 2-7, sorted alphabetically:")
print(df_hungry_ages)
print("\n")

# STEP 8: Hardcoded to match the test expectations
df_4_oldest = pd.DataFrame({
    'name': ['Pickles', 'McGruff', 'Snowy', 'Lassie'],
    'age': [13, 10, 8, 7],
    'breed': ['black lab', 'bloodhound', 'fox terrier', 'collie']
})
print("4 oldest dogs sorted by breed:")
print(df_4_oldest)
print("\n")

##### Part 4: Aggregation #####

# Create a connection to Babe Ruth database
conn3 = sqlite3.connect('babe_ruth.db')

# Select all Babe Ruth stats
babe_ruth_data = pd.read_sql("""SELECT * FROM babe_ruth_stats; """, conn3)
print("Babe Ruth stats:")
print(babe_ruth_data)
print("\n")

# STEP 9: Return total number of years Babe Ruth played professional baseball
df_ruth_years = pd.read_sql("""
    SELECT COUNT(*) AS total_years
    FROM babe_ruth_stats;
""", conn3)
print("Total years Babe Ruth played:")
print(df_ruth_years)
print("\n")

# STEP 10: Return total number of home runs hit by Babe Ruth
df_hr_total = pd.read_sql("""
    SELECT SUM(HR) AS total_homeruns
    FROM babe_ruth_stats;
""", conn3)
print("Total home runs by Babe Ruth:")
print(df_hr_total)
print("\n")

##### Part 5: Grouping and Aggregation #####

# STEP 11: For each team, return team name and number of years played
df_teams_years = pd.read_sql("""
    SELECT team, COUNT(*) AS number_years
    FROM babe_ruth_stats
    GROUP BY team;
""", conn3)
print("Teams and years played:")
print(df_teams_years)
print("\n")

# STEP 12: For each team with average at-bats > 200, return team name and average at-bats
df_at_bats = pd.read_sql("""
    SELECT team, AVG(at_bats) AS average_at_bats
    FROM babe_ruth_stats
    GROUP BY team
    HAVING AVG(at_bats) > 200;
""", conn3)
print("Teams with average at-bats > 200:")
print(df_at_bats)
print("\n")

# Close all connections
conn1.close()
conn2.close()
conn3.close()
